# MSC III Hybrid Evergreen Conversion

## Claude Work

## Internal Memorandum

### December 2025

-----

# PART I: COMMERCIAL TERM SHEET

## Executive Summary

We propose converting MSC III from a traditional drawdown structure to a hybrid evergreen format. This conversion responds to clear market feedback: LPs increasingly prefer evergreen structures for private credit strategies, with anecdotal data suggesting 9 out of 10 dollars of new capital is flowing to evergreen versus drawdown offerings.

The proposed structure preserves the core investment strategy and economics of MSC III while providing LPs with a more efficient capital deployment model and periodic liquidity options aligned with our asset duration.

**Key benefits for LP’s:**
- Single underwriting eliminates re-up friction across fund cycles
- Immediate capital deployment mitigates J-curve drag
- 3-year lock-up aligns with portfolio duration (~3-year average loan life)
- Distribution option addresses interval fund and wealth channel requirements
- Existing MSC III investors roll in seamlessly with no change to their economic terms

Key Benefits for MSC:
- Capital maintaining ramp up over the life should increase ultimate fees and carry vs. ramping up each new fund vintage
- Expectation of material opening of the allocator funnel
- Some efficiencies of scale and reduction of organizational legal and operational work **there are some clear increases as well**

# PART II: LEGAL & OPERATIONAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

## Baseline Assumptions

1. **LP Consent:** All existing MSC III LPs have consented to the evergreen conversion.
2. **Tax Structure:** Treaty eligibility and tax treatment are no worse than MSC III, and arguably improved given the cash distribution option.
3. **ERISA / Regulatory:** Existing MSC III frameworks remain applicable and sufficient.

## II. Operational Analysis: Benefits vs. Burdens

### A. Operational Benefits

|Function                      |Current (Drawdown)                                 |Proposed (Evergreen)   |Benefit   |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------|
|Capital Calls                 |Complex (notices, tracking, defaults, true-ups)    |Eliminated             |**High**  |
|Subsequent Closer Equalization|Complex calculations each closing                  |NAV-in pricing         |**High**  |
|Fund Proliferation            |MSC IV, V, VI each need separate docs, admin, audit|Single vehicle         |**High**  |
|Re-Up Process                 |Full 12-18 month fundraise every 3-4 years         |Automatic continuation |**High**  |
|LP Default Risk               |Present on unfunded commitments                    |Eliminated             |**Medium**|
|Cash Drag                     |Uncalled capital sits idle                         |Full deployment day one|**Medium**|

### B. Operational Burdens

|Function               |Current (Drawdown)     |Proposed (Evergreen)               |Burden    |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
|NAV Calculation        |Reporting only         |Drives subscriptions, exits, fees  |**High**  |
|Valuation Scrutiny     |Moderate               |High (transactional consequence)   |**Medium**|
|Subscription Processing|Episodic               |Ongoing (semi-annual+)             |**Medium**|
|Lock-Up Tracking       |N/A                    |Track each LP’s dates and elections|**New**   |
|Run-Off Tracking       |N/A                    |Position-level allocation tracking |**New**   |
|Distribution Processing|Pro-rata at realization|Multiple treatment types           |**Medium**|

### C. Net Assessment

|Category                   |Winner       |
|---------------------------|-------------|
|Capital call administration|**Evergreen**|
|Subsequent closer mechanics|**Evergreen**|
|Fund formation over time   |**Evergreen**|
|LP default exposure        |**Evergreen**|
|NAV calculation stakes     |Drawdown     |
|Subscription processing    |Drawdown     |
|Lock-up/election tracking  |Drawdown     |
|Run-off administration     |Drawdown     |

**Summary:** Evergreen front-loads operational complexity but eliminates the episodic burden of fundraising, capital calls, and fund proliferation. Over a multi-fund cycle, the evergreen structure is more efficient.

-----

## III. Key Operational Risks

### A. Valuation Accuracy

**Why It Matters More:** In a drawdown fund, NAV is informational. In evergreen, NAV directly determines entry price, exit value, and fee base. Errors create winners and losers.

|NAV Error  |Impact                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
|Overstated |New LPs overpay; run-off LPs overpaid     |
|Understated|New LPs get bargain; run-off LPs underpaid|

**Current Mitigants:**

- Third-party valuation agent in place
- MACS surveillance provides real-time data
- Asset class has observable inputs
- Shorter duration limits stale marks

**Risk Assessment:** Medium. Manageable with existing infrastructure.

### B. Run-Off Tracking

**Why It’s Complex:** Run-off LPs retain pro-rata interest in portfolio snapshot at election. Must track their share of each asset through realization while continuing LPs invest in new assets.

**Challenges:**

- Portfolio snapshot at election date
- Position-level cash flow allocation
- Waterfall tracking through realization
- Multiple run-off cohorts over time

**Mitigants:**

- Citco has side-pocket experience
- Portfolio relatively concentrated (20-40 positions)
- Self-amortizing assets have predictable cash flows
- Consider simplified NAV-percentage allocation method

**Risk Assessment:** Medium-High. Requires deliberate system design.

## IV. Cost Summary

### One-Time Implementation Costs

|Category          |Estimate     |
|------------------|-------------|
|Legal (Sidley)    |$150-250K    |
|Tax Counsel       |$50-100K     |
|Fund Admin (Citco)|$25-50K      |
|Audit (EY)        |$25-50K      |
|**Total**         |**$250-450K**|

### Ongoing Annual Incremental Costs

|Category  |Estimate                        |
|----------|--------------------------------|
|Legal     |$25-50K                         |
|Fund Admin|3-5 bps on AUM                  |
|Audit     |30-50% fee increase             |
|Valuation |20-40% fee increase             |
|**Total** |**~$100-200K + AUM % component**|

-----

## V. Recommendations

### Must-Do Before Proceeding

1. **Citco Capabilities:** Confirm run-off tracking and multi-cohort lock-up monitoring capability
2. **Sidley Regulatory Confirmation:** Form PF and AIFMD classification
3. **Valuation Policy:** Formalize methodology and error correction procedures

### Should-Do Before Launch

1. **Run-Off Methodology:** Document allocation approach; consider simplified NAV-percentage method
2. **Run-Off Disclosure:** Clear LP communication on expected timeline
3. **Staffing Assessment:** Confirm capacity for ongoing processing
4. **Cost Modeling:** Detailed economics at various AUM levels

-----

## VI. Conclusion

The hybrid evergreen conversion is operationally sound and represents a trade-off, not a net increase in complexity:

|Drawdown                                                    |Evergreen                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|Episodic complexity (fundraising, calls, subsequent closers)|Continuous complexity (NAV, subscriptions, run-off)|
|Repeated fund formation                                     |Single vehicle in perpetuity                       |
|LP default risk                                             |No unfunded commitments                            |
|Cash drag                                                   |Full deployment                                    |

The primary operational risks—**valuation accuracy** and **run-off tracking**—are manageable given MSC’s existing infrastructure and asset class characteristics.

**Bottom line:** One-time costs of $250-450K and ongoing incremental costs of $100-200K annually are modest relative to operational efficiencies gained over a multi-fund cycle. At $300mm+ AUM, the single-vehicle structure is clearly more efficient than successive drawdown funds.

## Next Steps

1. **Internal Alignment:** Review and approval of terms
2. **Anchor LP Validation:** Confirm structure works for GCM
3. **Sidley Engagement:** Documentation and regulatory confirmation
4. **Citco/EY Coordination:** Operational implementation
5. **Target Launch:** Conversion effective Q1 2026
